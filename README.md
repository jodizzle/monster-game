Tu Es Monstre?
==================

This repository contains my Ludum Dare 33 Compo entry, a simple (and my first) javascript game, completed within 48 hours.
The corresponding LD33 entry page can be seen [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=57780).
All development stopped before August 23rd, 9:00PM EDT, with [this](https://github.com/jodizzle/monster-game/commit/d2faa18bd6fa483a680a8e65c0ab72d31bdc3b9b) being the final commit.
This repository is effectively closed so as to provide a stable link to competition source code.

All future game developments will take place at a new repository, [monster-game-remix](https://github.com/jodizzle/monster-game-remix).
